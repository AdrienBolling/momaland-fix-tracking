An MO adaptation of the [multiwalker](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/sisl/multiwalker/) environment.

## Observation Space
See [PettingZoo documentation](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/sisl/multiwalker/#observation-space).

## Action Space
The action space is a vector representing the force exerted at the 4 available joints (hips and knees), giving a continuous action space with a 4 element vector.
The higher bound is `1`, the lower bound is `-1`.

## Reward Space
The reward space is a 3D vector containing rewards for:
- Maximizing distance traveled towards the end of the level during one step. `[-0.46, 0.46]`
- Penalty for agent falling. `[-110, 0]`
- Penalty for the package falling. `[-100, 0]`

## Episode Termination
The episode is terminated if the package is dropped. If `terminate_on_fall` is `True` (default), then environment is terminated if a single agent falls even if the package is still alive.

## Arguments
See [PettingZoo documentation](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/sisl/multiwalker/#arguments).
