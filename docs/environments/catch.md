## Description
A `Parallel` environment where drones learn how to surround a moving target trying to escape.

## Observation Space
The observation space is a continuous boxes with the length `(num_drones + 1) * 3` where each 3 values represent the coordinates of the drones in this order:
- the agent.
- the target.
- the other agents.
The higher bound is the `size` of the environment. Lower bound is `-size`.

Example:
`[x_0, y_0, z_0, x_targ, y_targ, z_targ, x_1, y_1, z_1, ..., x_n, y_n, z_n]`

## Action Space
The action space is a 3D vector representing the movement of the agent.
The higher bound is `1`, the lower bound is `-1`.

## Reward Space
The reward space is a 2D vector containing rewards for:
- Minimizing distance towards the target
- Maximizing average distance towards other agents (avoiding collision).
The higher bound is `[1, inf]`, the lower bound is `[-10, -10]`.

## Starting State
Where `size = 3`, the initial starting positions of the agents are `[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1]` while the target position is `[1, 1, 2.5]`

## Episode Termination
The episode is terminated if one of the following conditions are met:
- 2 agents collide.
- An agent and the target collide.
- An agent collides with the ground.

## Arguments
- render_mode (str, optional): The mode to display the rendering of the environment. Can be human or None.
- size (int, optional): Size of the area sides
- num_drones (int, optional): Amount of drones
- init_flying_pos (nparray[float], optional): 2d array containing the coordinates of the agents is a (3)-shaped array containing the initial XYZ position of the drones.
- init_target_location (nparray[float], optional): Array of the initial position of the moving target
- target_speed (float, optional): Distance traveled by the target at each timestep
